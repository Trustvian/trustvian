# A thin wrapper around pg_dump, not a backup engine. It exists to make the
# mistakes that matter hard to make: backing up the wrong database, silently
# overwriting a previous backup, leaving a half-written artifact where a good
# one is expected, writing a world-readable copy of security state, and
# having no way to tell later whether the file is still intact.
#
# Output is a NEW directory holding three files:
#
#   trustvian.dump   pg_dump custom-format archive: schema + data
#   MANIFEST         key=value metadata — no host, user, database, or secret
#   SHA256SUMS       checksums of the two files above (sha256sum -c format)
#
# Connection settings come ONLY from the standard libpq environment
# (PGHOST, PGPORT, PGUSER, PGDATABASE, PGPASSFILE / PGPASSWORD, PGSSLMODE,
# PGSERVICE). There is deliberately no --dsn flag: a connection string on a
# command line is visible to every user who can list processes.
#
# The backup is taken ONLINE. pg_dump reads the whole database in one
# REPEATABLE READ snapshot, and every Trustvian write is a single-row
# transaction, so the archive is consistent without stopping Trustvian. See
# docs/operations.md § Backup consistency.
#
# Exit status is 0 only when the archive was written, its table of contents
# was confirmed to hold both Trustvian tables with their data, and its
# checksums were recorded.
