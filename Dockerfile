# The official Trustvian Collector image: an OpenTelemetry Collector with
# the Trustvian processor, which is the long-lived service this repository
# produces. The `trustvian` CLI is a batch tool and ships as a binary
# instead (see docs/release-guide.md).
#
# Published as ghcr.io/trustvian/trustvian-collector by
# .github/workflows/release.yml on a version tag. This file is also
# buildable locally with `make container-build`, which pushes nothing.
#
# Distinct from deployments/docker-compose/Dockerfile.collector, which
# remains the reference deployment's from-source build. Both are kept
# deliberately: a developer must be able to run the repository without a
# published image.
#
# See docs/supply-chain.md and
# docs/tasks/041-container-supply-chain-security.md.

# Pinned to the toolchain go.mod declares.

# Runtime: distroless static, non-root.
#
# `static` (not `base`) because the binary is static — there is no libc to
# provide. The image is chosen for two concrete requirements rather than
# for size:
#
#   - It carries CA certificates. The Collector dials PostgreSQL, possibly
#     with sslmode=verify-full, and may export telemetry over TLS. A
#     `scratch` image has no trust store, which would break verification
#     quietly.
#   - It has no shell and no package manager. Operating the Collector is
#     config-in / logs-out with all state in PostgreSQL, so a shell adds
#     attack surface without adding an operational capability.
#
# The accepted cost is that `docker exec` cannot open a shell; see
# docs/supply-chain.md § Debugging the image.

# No HEALTHCHECK: this image has no shell and no curl by design, and a

# would discard a deliberate security property to satisfy a convenience.
